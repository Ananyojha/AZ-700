## Why Azure Expressroute ?
`excellent and cost-effective option for scenarios like periodic data migration, replication for business continuity, disaster recovery and other high-availability strategies.`
one usecase could be run a corporate intranet application in Azure that authenticates your customers with an on-premises Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) service and serves them without routing traffic through the public internet.

**Your data transfer may not take the ideal / fastest path ---> So ExpressRoute helps here**
